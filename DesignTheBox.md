Design the Box
===

What are the main features? _List the main three or four._

1. Feature 1
2. Feature 2
3. Feature 3 _(you should have around this many, just think of the main features)_
4. Feature 4 _(if you have 4; if you have more that this you are either listing more minor features as main features or you may be planning to make something that does too much, at least for a product you can develop in a semester)_

What is it called? _You should give the current name here._

What is the logo/graphic? _You can describe it here, link to it if available, or just say it will eventually be available, this is useful but not critical at the start_

What is a more detailed description? _Here you can list all the features you can think of. This is like the longer description on the back of the box, or in the details when you click through after seeing the main features._

What is required to run the product? _This is information on the platform requirements, e.g., the needed OS or runtime, memory, or hardware requirements like location services. I would give this as a list, since that is easier to understand._
